# Part 1
Introduction to MATLAB that utilizes vector operations to calulate and plot the sum Sk(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + . . . + x^kâˆ’1 + x^k where k = 5, 10, 20 for x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5. 

# Part 2
Numerically solved an RC circuit for the capacitor voltage. This involved comparing the analyitical solution (Vc = e^(-t/RC)) to the numerical solution (V<sup>2</sup>)
