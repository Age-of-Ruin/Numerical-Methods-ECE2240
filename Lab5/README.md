# Numerical Differentiation and Integration
## Differentiation
Implements forward, backward, and centered difference approximations of the derivative. It uses a 1st order Taylor Series for a less accurate approximation and a 2nd order Taylor Series for a more accurate approximation.

## Integration
Implements numerical integration using pulse, trapezoidal, and Simpson's 1/3 Rule.
